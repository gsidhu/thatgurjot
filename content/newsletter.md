Hey. Do you think reading my needless opinions could brighten your day?

Well, look no further because I have recently begun collecting my fleeting thoughts over [at Hey World](https://world.hey.com/gurjot/) in the form of a newsletter. I have no clear plan about this newsletter but I can say with certainity that it'll sum up to be *an exposition of my evolving worldview*.

What I have written about so far â€“
* [Clarity, do you seek it?](https://world.hey.com/gurjot/clarity-do-you-seek-it-56bf9fe9)
* [Should you hire an accountant?](https://world.hey.com/gurjot/should-you-hire-an-accountant-54372393)
* [Would you like to be electro-jogged?](https://world.hey.com/gurjot/would-you-like-to-be-electro-jogged-fa79dffa)
* [Should you drown in the Ganga?](https://world.hey.com/gurjot/should-you-drown-in-the-ganga-36e93ea9)
* [Where is the meadow of no worries?](https://world.hey.com/gurjot/where-is-the-meadow-of-no-worries-9d917f5b)
* [What is my meaningful contribution to society?](https://world.hey.com/gurjot/what-is-my-contribution-to-society-d4f84ebe)
* [Am I a Digital Gardner now?](https://world.hey.com/gurjot/am-i-a-digital-gardener-now-0594246e)

There's a subscribe button at the end of the newsletter page. You can submit your email to subscribe. I will probably write once a week. If that is too frequent for you I recommend not subscribing. You won't miss out on much.
