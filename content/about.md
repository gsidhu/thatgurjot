Hi. 

I am an independent researcher working on the intersection of human behaviour, systems dynamics and education.

As of February 2021, I divide my time across these activities -
1. I work as a consultant with an education consultancy group. I have worked across several states of India with numerous governmental and non-governmental agencies with a focus on socio-economically disadvantaged learners.
2. I hack together small projects like [Chachi.app](https://chachi.app) and [Buzo.dog](https://buzo.dog). These days I am trying to turn Chachi into a [Wiki for Teaching](https://chachi.app/#/coming-soon).
3. I write rants on this blog. Mostly about [education](../categories/pedagoguey) in India.

In another life I briefly did computational science research and stand-up comedy.

I exist on the internet as thatgurjot.

So it goes.
