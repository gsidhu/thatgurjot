Hi. 

I work on the intersection of human behaviour, systems dynamics and education.

As of May 2021, I divide my time across these activities -

**Consulting**

* I work as a consultant with an [education consultancy group](https://ignus-erg.org). I have worked across several states of India with numerous governmental and non-governmental agencies with a focus on socio-economically disadvantaged learning environments.
* I work as a freelance consultant offering services in data analysis, workshop facilitation and Ed-Tech. Most recently, I worked with a research team writing a report on perceptions of violence against women and girls by providing support in quantitative data analysis.

**Learning**

* I hack together small projects like [Table Image to Text](https://github.com/gsidhu/table_image_to_text), [Chachi.app](https://chachi.app) and [Buzo.dog](https://buzo.dog) to learn new technologies and create proof of concept experiments.
* I do an above-average amount of reading and watching. This information gets turned into [Book Notes](/categories/book-notes), [Distilled Knowledge](/categories/distilled-knowledge), or a blog/newsletter post.

**Writing**

* I write rants on this blog. Mostly about [education](/categories/pedagoguey) in India.
* I write on my newsletter over at [Hey World](https://world.hey.com/gurjot). Mostly about questions that I am presently struggling with.

In another life I briefly did [computational science research](/docs/Gurjot%20Sidhu%20-%20Masters%20Thesis.pdf), [theatre](https://blueprintmasquerades.com/past-productions/2017-arcadia/) and [stand-up comedy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE_SaLGSMFqJTkhJUaxOIPA). I also ran a [podcast](https://gsidhu.github.io/simplifyd/) with a friend.

These days I am learning how to juggle and skateboard.

I think I am a generalist? (As defined in [Range](https://davidepstein.com/the-range/) ([my notes](/book-notes/range/)))

I exist on the internet as thatgurjot. Here's my latest CV.

So it goes.
