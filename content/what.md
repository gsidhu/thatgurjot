Borrowing the analogy from Andy Matuschak, this is me [working with my garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu).

This website is the door to my laboratory. 

1. A lot of the things in here are works in progress - just like all of us.
2. There is a back office that isn't visible from the door. Unfortunately, dear visitor, your only vantage point is the door.

Everything here is free for you to see and touch.

If you need me, just shout loud enough via email and I'll be right there with you.
