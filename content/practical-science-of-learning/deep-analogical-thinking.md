## When learning
Build through analogies.

Think of understanding a concept like climbing a rock. Use analogies as your anchors along the way.

Not only will the analogies act as [[memory anchors]] they'll also allow you to check if your understanding has changed/improved because you will want to update your analogy for an earlier concept at a later stage in the process.

## When solving problems
Use multiple analogies. Your instinct will be to take the first one and run with it - don't do that.

Find analogies that are as far removed from the subject matter as possible. 

Break away from the inside view and find external perspective.
