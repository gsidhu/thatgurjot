Based on [Ali S. Harfouch's tweet thread](https://twitter.com/asharfouch/status/1362694314975969281) and my personal experience.

Think of concepts as your orienting anchors and your knowledge of the history of a subject as a map. You can then traverse through information, not just quicker but also more effectively. Let go of the twigs and keep a picture of the forest.
