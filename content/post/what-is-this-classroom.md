**_Enter teacher_**

<kbd>Students:</kbd> (in a singsong tone) Gooh-hud mawr-ning, ma’am.

<kbd>Teacher:</kbd> (waves hand loosely) Sit-down, children.

**_Students ruffle their makeshift backpacks, made mostly out of pesticide sacks with odd capitalist branding_**

<kbd>Teacher:</kbd> Okay, class. Today we are going to learn about the body parts. (lifts her arms up and moves her fingers like an overly-obvious puppeteer) What is this?

<kbd>Students:</kbd> Yes ma’am!

<kbd>Teacher:</kbd> (laughs at their ineptitude) No, _what is this?_

**_No response from the students; only confused faces_**

<kbd>Teacher:</kbd> (brings her arms to the front and moves her fingers in an almost tremulous demeanour) _What is this?!_

<kbd>Students:</kbd> (almost fumbling) WHAT IS THIS!

<kbd>Teacher:</kbd> (visibly annoyed) No! This is fingers. What is this?

<kbd>Students:</kbd> (comfortably) Fin-guhrr-ss.

<kbd>Teacher:</kbd> (points to her nose) What is this?

<kbd>Student #1:</kbd> (confidently points his arm in an inverted Nazi salute) नाक! (Hindi for “nose”)

<kbd>Teacher:</kbd> (scowling) No! Not like this!

<kbd>Students:</kbd> (in unison) Not like this!

<kbd>Teacher:</kbd> Argh. In English.

<kbd>Student #2:</kbd> (softly, with reservation) In-ain-guh-liss?

<kbd>Teacher:</kbd> (taps her nose several times with her finger) _What is this?_

<kbd>Student #1 and #2:</kbd> (mockingly yet hoping that they are correct) Inainguhliss!

**_Teacher lifts Student #1 by the arm, almost tossing him across the room_**

<kbd>Teacher:</kbd> What are you doing? Huh? Go stand in front of the class.

**_Student #1 chants “एक दो एक” (1–2–1) like an obedient foot soldier, walks to the blackboard, faces the class, and raises his arms straight up_**

<kbd>Teacher:</kbd> Okay. Now we… (stops mid-sentence as the realisation of the presence of an external researcher in the room dawns on her)

**_She flails her arm towards Student #1, trying to mime to him to lower his raised arms, while simultaneously grappling with her limited vocabulary to churn out an intimidating instruction — in English_**

<kbd>Teacher:</kbd> _What is this?!_

**_Pause._**

<kbd>Student #1:</kbd> (smiling sheepishly) Fin-guhrr-ss.

**Postscript**

The events depicted in this scene occurred with almost 99% one-to-one correspondence in a government primary school in India. The “external researcher” vouches for its authenticity.
