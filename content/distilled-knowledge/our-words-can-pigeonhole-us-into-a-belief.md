In a situation where we try to put our reasons or feelings into words, often the words we choose become our beliefs about that situation. The more we repeat the same words, the more convinced we become about the belief.

Note: The belief could be rooted in truth. So it's not always a bad thing.

Example: Why did you quit that last job? Couldn't put it into exact words at first, but once you did - now you repeat the same words each timee and have started to believe them.
