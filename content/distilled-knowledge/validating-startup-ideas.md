1.  Create a problem hypothesis from your idea
	1.  \[Group of people\] have a problem \[their problem\]
2.  Set up a system to pull people to you

		2.  Qualifiers: Helps you filter people to better target the ones you should follow-up with and segment responses to other questions.
		3.  Discovery: People will tell you things if you ask them. Read every response and categorize each of your open-ended responses into buckets. With open-ended questions you’ll also discover the words people use. These responses are useful when you need to write marketing copy and iterate or test your landing page.
3.  Find the pattern of pain
