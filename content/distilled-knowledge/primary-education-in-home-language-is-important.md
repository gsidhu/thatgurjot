1.  It creates a secure, familiar environment
2.  Which in turn makes it easier for parents to get involved with the childâ€™s education
3.  And the child is able to freely and creatively express herself
4.  Plus it creates an equitable environment since the disadvantage of being unfamiliar or less exposed to the language of instruction (English or regional language) is removed - therefore kids from marginalised backgrounds (like tribals) can thrive
5.  Research shows that the brain is able to grasp advanced abstractions much easier in home language 
6.  It creates an appreciation for the diverse multilingual culture since you are exposed to more literature in a variety of languages
