By Gian-Carlo Rota

> The advice we give others is always the advice we need to follow most.

1. **Every lecture should make only one point.** And repeat that point over and over.
2. **Never run over time.** Show some respect for *their* time.
3. **Relate to your audience.** A tiny mention can keep someone from quitting.
4. **Give people something to take home.** Even if they miss your point, they should remember you for *something*.
5. **Make sure the blackboard is spotless.** If you take your work seriously, so will they.
6. **Make it easy for people to take notes.** What they write is what they remember.
7. **Share the same work multiple times.** Iteration makes things better.
8. **You are more likely to be remembered for your expository work.** Genius is finite; make genius accessible.
9. **Every mathematician has only a few tricks.** Be a specialised generalist.
10. **Don’t worry about small mistakes.** Don't chase perfection.
11. **Use Feynman’s method for solving problems.** Slow and steady against hard problems.
12. **Write informative introductions.** Time is scarce, first impression is crucial.
